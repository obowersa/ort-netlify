# Community Meetings
Join a SIG or attend our General meetings. We look forward to your help and input on the Ortelius project:

- **Ortelius General Community Meeting** – this is an ‘all hands’ meeting giving the SIGs an opportunity to share their progress.
- **Architecture and Marketplace SIG** – This group is driven to help define the future roadmap of Ortelius including a global marketplace for sharing microservices and their deployment requirements.
- **Ortelius Outreach SIG** – This group wants to help with driving adoption and messaging of the Ortelius platform.
