# Our Mission

Our mission is to simplify the adoption of modern architecture through a world-class microservice management platform driven by a supportive and diverse global open source community

# What is Ortelius?

Ortelius is a microservice management platform that visualizes ‘logical’ application versions in a microservice architecture. From packaging to deployment, Ortelius maps your microservice configurations with their relationships to the application that use them.  Your microservice configurations are versioned and tracked across all clusters so you always know before you go.  The latest version of Ortelius is maintained by the Ortelius Community managed by the Continuous Delivery Foundation (Linux Foundation).  It was originally created by  DeployHub and OpenMake Software.

# Abraham Ortelius – Our Inspiration
Abraham Ortelius made his name by collecting data from scientists, geographers, and cartographers of his time and transforming it into what the world now knows as a world Atlas. His Atlas, titled Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World), was published on May 20, 1570. His Atlas disrupted the way the world was seen, with the first concepts imagining continental drift. Also of interest are the sea monsters shown in the water – mythical creatures that were a subject of fascination in Ortelius’ generation.

# A Thought Leader in Sharing
Ortelius also in some ways created on open source community of his day. To accomplish his goal, he was the first cartographers to give credit to his fellow scientists by adding their names to the Atlas. Ortelius was known to have corresponded with other professionals throughout Europe and pulled together their knowledge to create his publication and a truly global view of the world.

Thank you Abraham Ortelius for showing us the way.
